      <p>Forms are an essential part of the Internet, as they provide a way for websites to capture information from users and to process requests, and they offer controls for nearly every imaginable use of an application. Through controls or fields, forms can request a small amount of information—often a search query or a username and password—or a large amount of information—perhaps shipping and billing information or an entire job application.</p>
      <p>We need to know how to build forms in order to acquire user input. In this lesson we’ll discuss how to use HTML to mark up a form, which elements to use to capture different types of data, and how to style forms with CSS. We won’t get too deep into how information from a form is processed and handled on the back end of a website. Form processing is a deeper topic, outside the realm of this book; for now we’ll stick to the creation and styling of forms.</p>
